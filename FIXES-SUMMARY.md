# 🛠️ SmartIntake AI - Fixes Summary

## ✅ What We Fixed

### **1. Level System (L1-L9, M3-M5)** ✅
**Problem:** Level was determined by AI, not user-controlled  
**Solution:** Added manual level selection

**Changes:**
- Created `level-selector.tsx` component with dropdown
- **IC Levels**: L1-L9 (Junior → Distinguished IC)
- **Management Levels**: M3-M5 (Manager → Director)
- Level is now **required** before analyzing JD
- User must explicitly select their level

**UI Location:**
```
Step 2: Hiring Manager & Level
├─ Level (Required) ← NEW DROPDOWN
└─ Organization Context
```

---

### **2. Function Auto-Population from Department** ✅
**Problem:** Function was AI-determined, not from department  
**Solution:** Function automatically uses department from org context

**How It Works:**
1. User enters Hiring Manager name
2. System pulls their **department** (via Glean or manual entry)
3. **Function auto-populates** from that department
4. Updates live when department changes

**Example:**
```
Manager: Camila Ribeiro
Department: Operations  ← User enters or Glean fetches
Function: Operations    ← Auto-populated ✅
```

### **3. Job Description Display on Confluence** ✅
**Problem:** Confluence page didn't show the full JD  
**Solution:** Added JD section at the top of published pages

**New Confluence Page Structure:**
```
# INTAKE – L4 Operations – 2025-10-01

## 📄 Job Description  ← NEW!
